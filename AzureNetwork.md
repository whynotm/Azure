# :sunny: VDC vs Network
The key to unlock the advantages of VDC is a centralized hub and spoke network topology with a mix of Azure services and features:

- Azure Virtual Network,
- Network security groups,
- Virtual network peering,
- User-defined routes, 
- Azure Identity with role-based access control (RBAC) 
- optionally Azure Firewall, Azure DNS, Azure Front Door, and Azure Virtual WAN.

#When designing a VDC implementation, there are several pivotal issues to consider:
1.Identity and directory service :
  - key aspect of all datacenters
  - The goals of this process should be to increase security and productivity while decreasing cost, downtime, and repetitive manual tasks.
  - Notes : Azure Active Directory is a comprehensive, highly available identity and access management cloud solution that combines core directory services, advanced identity governance, and application access management
2. Security infrastructure
 - segregation of traffic in a VDC implementation's specific virtual network segment.
 - VNet isolation, access control lists (ACLs), load balancers, IP filters, and traffic flow policies.
 - (NAT) separates internal network traffic from external traffic.
 Notes : Azure Fabric  And  Azyre Hypervisor
3. Connectivity to the cloud
  -  Internet, but also to on-premises networks and datacenters.
  - Azure Firwall  OR  VNA 
  - User Defined routes
  - NSG
  -  Azure Site-to-Site VPN  && Azure Virtual WAN (Dashbords) && Express Route
  Notes : DDOS
  4. Connectivity within the cloud
    - VNET
    - VNET Peering (same Azure region or even across regions)
